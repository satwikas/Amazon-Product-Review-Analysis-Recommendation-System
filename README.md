Overview

This project focuses on developing a system that enhances the e-commerce shopping experience by analyzing Amazon product reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. The system extracts valuable insights from user reviews, gauges sentiment, identifies trends, and provides personalized product recommendations. These insights help consumers make informed purchasing decisions and provide sellers with actionable feedback to optimize their product offerings.
